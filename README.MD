# Duck Tales

## Purpose

This is a basic Twitter clone, but instead of birds we have ducks.

## Use

- clone the repo
- install PHP dependencies `composer install`
- install JS dependencies `yarn install` (you may also use npm)
- run `yarn watch` to transpile CSS/JS assets
- run `symfony server:start` to launch the dev server (make sure you have installed Symfony globally via Composer)
